## Introduction

This is a repository for my notes on *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan* by John Kruschke.
As I have some experience with the topic by working through Richard McElreath's [*Statistical Rethinking*](https://github.com/jhrcook/statistical-rethinking), I may skip a few sections or chapters.
